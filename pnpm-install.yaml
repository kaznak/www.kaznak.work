- name: '@mdx-js/loader'
  version: '^1.6.5'
  addition:
    - react
    - '@mdx-js/react'
  comment: |
    `@mdx-js/loader` automatically inserts import statements for `react` and `@mdx-js/react` to generated react component from MDX file.
    This behaviour can be changed by giving the import statements as the renderer option to  `@mdx-js/loader`.
